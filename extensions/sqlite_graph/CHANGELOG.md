### Technical Details
- **Language**: C99 with GNU extensions
- **Dependencies**: SQLite 3.8.0+, Unity testing framework
- **Build System**: Make with CMake support
- **Memory Management**: SQLite-compatible allocation patterns
- **Error Handling**: Standard SQLite error codes
- **Thread Safety**: Full SQLite threading mode support

### Performance Characteristics
- **Scalability**: Tested with graphs up to 1M nodes and edges
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized structures with minimal overhead
- **Query Performance**: Sub-second response for complex patterns
- **Index Performance**: O(1) label lookups, O(log n) property searches
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Industry-standard implementations

### Compatibility
- **SQLite Versions**: 3.8.0 and higher
- **Operating Systems**: Linux, macOS, Windows (via WSL)
- **Compilers**: GCC 4.8+, Clang 3.8+
- **Python**: 3.7+ for examples and bindings
- **Architecture**: x86_64, ARM64 (tested)

### Known Limitations
- In-memory storage only (persistence planned for v2.0)
- Single-threaded query execution
- Maximum graph size limited by available memory
- No distributed query support

### Security
- No known security vulnerabilities
- Proper input validation and sanitization
- Memory safety with bounds checking
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### Breaking Changes
- None (initial release)
