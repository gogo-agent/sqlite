## Summary

This pull request completes Step 10 of our project plan focusing on final verification and comprehensive documentation. The updates include:

1. **Clean Checkout and Single-Command Build/Test**
    - Implemented a single-command build script (`build_and_test.sh`) to verify a clean checkout builds and runs successfully.
    - Fixed issues with function declarations in `graph-vtab-hardened.c`.

2. **Testing Documentation**
    - Created `TESTING.md` to document the process of adding new tests, using the build system, running with sanitizers, and interpreting results.
