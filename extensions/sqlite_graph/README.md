# SQLite Graph Database Extension

A powerful SQLite extension that adds graph database capabilities with full Cypher query support. Build sophisticated graph applications with the reliability of SQLite and the expressiveness of Cypher.

## Features

- **Full Graph Database Support**: Nodes, edges, properties, labels, and relationship types
- **Cypher Query Language**: Complete implementation of openCypher standard
- **SQLite Integration**: Seamless integration with existing SQLite databases
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Shortest path, PageRank, centrality measures, and more
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient indexing and query planning
- **Thread Safe**: Supports SQLite's threading modes
- **Python Bindings**: Easy-to-use Python interface

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sqlite-graph.git
cd sqlite-graph

# Build the extension
make

# The extension will be built as build/libgraph.so
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import sqlite3

# Load the extension
conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
conn.enable_load_extension(True)
conn.load_extension("./build/libgraph.so")

# Create a graph virtual table
conn.execute("CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE graph USING graph()")

# Add nodes and edges using Cypher
conn.execute("CYPHER 'CREATE (p:Person {name: \"Alice\", age: 30})'")
conn.execute("CYPHER 'CREATE (p:Person {name: \"Bob\", age: 25})'")
conn.execute("CYPHER 'MATCH (a:Person {name: \"Alice\"}), (b:Person {name: \"Bob\"}) CREATE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)'")

# Query the graph
result = conn.execute("CYPHER 'MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name, p.age'").fetchall()
print(result)  # [('Alice', 30), ('Bob', 25)]
```

### Advanced Features

```python
# Find shortest path
path = conn.execute("""
    CYPHER 'MATCH path = shortestPath((a:Person {name: "Alice"})-[*]-(b:Person {name: "Bob"}))
            RETURN path'
""").fetchall()

# PageRank algorithm
pagerank = conn.execute("""
    CYPHER 'CALL graph.pageRank() YIELD nodeId, score RETURN nodeId, score'
""").fetchall()

# Pattern matching with complex relationships
results = conn.execute("""
    CYPHER 'MATCH (p1:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(p2:Person)-[:WORKS_AT]->(c:Company)
            WHERE p1.age > 25
            RETURN p1.name, p2.name, c.name'
""").fetchall()
```

## Documentation

- [Installation Guide](INSTALL.md) - Detailed build and installation instructions
- [API Reference](API.md) - Complete Cypher query language documentation
- [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) - Development setup and guidelines
- [Examples](examples/) - Sample applications and tutorials

## Architecture

The extension consists of several key components:

- **Virtual Table Interface**: SQLite virtual table implementation for graph operations
- **Cypher Parser**: Full openCypher query parser and AST generator
- **Query Planner**: Optimizes Cypher queries for efficient execution
- **Storage Engine**: Efficient in-memory graph storage with persistence
- **Algorithm Library**: Graph algorithms (shortest path, centrality, etc.)

## Performance

- **Scalability**: Handles graphs with millions of nodes and edges
- **Indexing**: Automatic label and property indexing for fast queries
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized data structures with minimal overhead
- **Query Optimization**: Cost-based query planning for complex patterns

## Examples

### Social Network Analysis
```python
# Create a social network
conn.execute("CYPHER 'CREATE (alice:Person {name: \"Alice\", city: \"NYC\"})'")
conn.execute("CYPHER 'CREATE (bob:Person {name: \"Bob\", city: \"LA\"})'")
conn.execute("CYPHER 'CREATE (carol:Person {name: \"Carol\", city: \"NYC\"})'")

# Add friendships
conn.execute("CYPHER 'MATCH (a:Person {name: \"Alice\"}), (b:Person {name: \"Bob\"}) CREATE (a)-[:FRIENDS]->(b)'")
conn.execute("CYPHER 'MATCH (a:Person {name: \"Alice\"}), (c:Person {name: \"Carol\"}) CREATE (a)-[:FRIENDS]->(c)'")

# Find mutual friends
mutual_friends = conn.execute("""
    CYPHER 'MATCH (a:Person {name: \"Alice\"})-[:FRIENDS]->(mutual)<-[:FRIENDS]-(b:Person {name: \"Bob\"})
            RETURN mutual.name as mutual_friend'
""").fetchall()
```

### Recommendation System
```python
# Find people Alice might know (friends of friends)
recommendations = conn.execute("""
    CYPHER 'MATCH (alice:Person {name: \"Alice\"})-[:FRIENDS]->(friend)-[:FRIENDS]->(recommendation)
            WHERE NOT (alice)-[:FRIENDS]->(recommendation) AND alice <> recommendation
            RETURN recommendation.name, COUNT(*) as mutual_friends
            ORDER BY mutual_friends DESC'
""").fetchall()
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test
cd build/tests && ./test_cypher_basic

# Run with coverage
